# What emotional issues does Caleb have?

- Mild OCD. Caleb has to press buttons a prime number of times. This works well if the first press goes well but results in problems when the first two presses goes wrong, as then he must press endlessly until a failure repeats itself. He once pressed a button for 7 hours straight before he successfully got it in the off state. Some have suggested this is irrational to Caleb, but Caleb is fully aware of the irritating nature of it. He is simply compelled to act in that way. His brain wont let him act in any other way.
